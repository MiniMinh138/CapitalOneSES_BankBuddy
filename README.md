# CapitalOneSES_BankBuddy
An app that promotes financial literacy with the incentive of keeping your BankBuddy healthy. This was created during CapitalOne's 2-Day Hackathon and takes inspiration from the Tamagotchi game.

For the BankAccount Number, the default is "1020". With our mock database, "613" and "3" are the other working account numbers for demonstration purposes.
