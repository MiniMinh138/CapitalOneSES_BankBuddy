# CapitalOneSES_BankBuddy
An app that promotes financial literacy with the incentive of keeping your BankBuddy healthy. This was created during CapitalOne's 2-Day Hackathon and takes inspiration from the Tamagotchi game.
For the BankAccount Number, the default is "1020". With our mock database, "613" is the only other account for demonstration purposes.
